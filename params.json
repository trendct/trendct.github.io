{"name":"TrendCT Hackathon","tagline":"October 6, 2015","body":"# Small State, Big Debate\r\n\r\n##### Welcome to the TrendCT and Connecticut Mirror hackathon on disparate treatment by race.\r\n\r\nBetween 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. (or earlier), we will focus on creating useful tools or extracting unexpected stories from Connecticut's racial profiling data, which records every traffic stop in the state.\r\n\r\nIt is a comprehensive database that aims to diagnose where racial profiling may be happening. We are able to work on this unique data set thanks to the tireless work from the [Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy](http://www.ccsu.edu/imrp/) at Central Connecticut State University and the [Connecticut Data Collaborative](http://ctdata.org/).\r\n\r\n#### Communication\r\n\r\nWe have a Slack channel! \r\n\r\nhttps://dataconn.slack.com/\r\n\r\nThe channel for everyone is #ctrace-hackathon.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a login, let me know.\r\n\r\n#### Hashtags\r\n\r\nIf you're tweeting, please use #ctrace\r\n\r\n#### The traffic stop data\r\n* raw - [Oct. 2013 - Sep. 2015](http://ctrp3viz.s3.amazonaws.com/data/Connecticut_102013_32015.csv)\r\n* map - [Oct. 2013 - Sep. 2015](http://ctrp3viz.s3.amazonaws.com/data/Connecticut_102013_32015.csv)\r\n* data portal - [Oct. 2013 - Sep. 2015](http://ctrp3.ctdata.org/rawdata/)\r\n\r\n#### IMRP reports and methodology\r\n* September 2014 report [[CTData.org]](http://ctrp3viz.s3.amazonaws.com/data/report_0914.pdf)\r\n* April 2015 Report [[CTData.org]](http://ctrp3viz.s3.amazonaws.com/data/April%202015%20Connecticut%20Racial%20Profiling%20Report.pdf)\r\n* Exploring the statistical techniques used in the Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy report  [[CTData.org]](http://ctrp3.ctdata.org/news/report_story)\r\n\r\n#### Stories from the data\r\n* Summary graphics [[CTData.org]](http://ctrp3.ctdata.org/news/year_two_first_look)\r\n* Police being kinder, gentler to drivers in Connecticut [[TrendCT]](http://trendct.org/2015/09/24/how-frequently-police-departments-pull-over-and-ticket-drivers/)\r\n* Quiz: What correlates with traffic tickets per town?
